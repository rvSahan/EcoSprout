# EcoSprout
EcoSprout is a seed-selling platform, but behind the scenes, itâ€™s packed with features weâ€™ve carefully crafted for a seamless user and admin experience. Hereâ€™s a peek at the tech stack and development process:

ðŸ›  Tech Stack:

Android Studio (Java) â€” Building a smooth and responsive mobile app

Firebase Firestore â€” Real-time database for products, orders, users, and categories

Firebase Cloud Messaging â€” Keeping users updated without the old server key method

PayHere Integration â€” Secure and reliable online payments

Google Maps API â€” For location-based features and easy navigation

Base64 Encoding â€” Storing profile images efficiently in Firestore without using Cloud Storage

---

ðŸŒ± Features Weâ€™ve Built:

Product Management: Add, update, and track seed inventory

Cart & Checkout: User-friendly shopping with real-time quantity updates

Admin Dashboard: Visualizing user, product, and order stats with interactive charts

Contact Us: Google Maps for directions and WhatsApp integration for instant support

Profile Management: Storing images as Base64 strings directly in Firestore

Order System: Storing orders, clearing the cart, and updating product quantities on successful payment

This project has taught me so much about backend optimization, real-time data handling, and seamless third-party API integration. Itâ€™s a perfect blend of functionality and user experience â€” and weâ€™re just getting started!
Fellow devs, if youâ€™ve worked on similar projects or have tips on Firebase best practices, Iâ€™d love to hear from you! ðŸ’¡
